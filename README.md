## README-FILE-Cheatsheet
A Readme file in a repo contains all the information regarding installation, working, development on the local server, and future use. It is very important for every tech enthusiast to learn how to write the perfect Readme.üë®‚ÄçüíªüõéÔ∏è

In this Cheatsheet you can find everything which is required to create a appreciable README.md File.<br/>
Hope you will find it helpful. If you find it helpful, don't forget to give it a star.‚≠ê

### Emphasis
<pre>
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~</pre>

### Lists
<pre>
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖYou can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖTo have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.‚ãÖ‚ãÖ
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖNote that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.‚ãÖ‚ãÖ
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluse</pre>

### Links
<pre>
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com</pre>

### Code and Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).

```no-highlight
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>```</code>, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

```no-highlight
 ```javascript
 var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
 alert(s);
 ```
 
 ```python
 s = "Python syntax highlighting"
 print s
 ```
 
 ```
 No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
 But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
 ```
```

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github). 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

### Tables
Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

<pre>
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3</pre>

### Blockquotes
<pre>
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.</pre>

### Inline HTML
You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.
<pre>
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl></pre>
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
### Horizontal Rule
<pre>
Three or more...

---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores</pre>

### Line Breaks

My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit <Enter> once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. "Markdown Toggle" is your friend.

Here are some things to try out:
<pre>
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.</pre>
